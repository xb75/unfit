Unfit
=====

This program has been written to provide access to the useful information from
the Activity FIT files generated by my Garmin Edge 510.

The basic idea is just to get the heart-rate, speed, cadence etc from the
files, and generate a CSV file for further processing.

Building
========
$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install

Running
=======
unfit -o <file.csv> <fit-file>

For further information, see man-page included.
