Output CSV data to <file> rather than to stdout.
.br
If multiple input files are specified, all data will be output to this one file.

Add data-points for every second which doesn't have one. This can make further processing in a spread-sheet easier.

Do not scan files "~/.unfit" and "/etc/unfit" for default options
.IP "--altitude | --no-altitude"
Include or exclude the altitude column.

A small reminder of the command-line options.

The version. Note that this documentation is for version 0.1
